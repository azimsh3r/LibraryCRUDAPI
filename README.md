**Library Management System API**

This README provides an overview of the API for a Library Management System, which handles entities such as Person and Book. The system is developed using Spring MVC, with Thymeleaf for view rendering, and utilizes Spring Data JPA for data access. PostgreSQL is employed as the underlying database for storing both Person and Book entities.

### Endpoints:

1. **Person Endpoints:**

   - **GET /api/persons**: Retrieve a list of all persons.
   - **GET /api/persons/{id}**: Retrieve information about a specific person by ID.
   - **POST /api/persons**: Create a new person.
   - **PUT /api/persons/{id}**: Update information for a specific person.
   - **DELETE /api/persons/{id}**: Delete a person by ID.

2. **Book Endpoints:**

   - **GET /api/books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
   - **GET /api/books/{id}**: Retrieve information about a specific book by ID.
   - **POST /api/books**: Create a new book.
   - **PUT /api/books/{id}**: Update information for a specific book.
   - **DELETE /api/books/{id}**: Delete a book by ID.

### Data Models:

1. **Person:**
   - id (Long)
   - firstName (String)
   - lastName (String)
   - email (String)
   - dateOfBirth (Date)
   - booksBorrowed (List<Book>)

2. **Book:**
   - id (Long)
   - title (String)
   - author (String)
   - publicationDate (Date)
   - isbn (String)
   - person (Person)

### Technologies Used:

- **Spring MVC:** Framework for building robust web applications.
- **Thymeleaf:** Server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies the implementation of data access layers by providing APIs for CRUD operations.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database management system known for its reliability and robustness.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL:**
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a database.
   - Update `application.properties` with the database connection details.
   - 
### Usage:

- Use the provided endpoints to manage persons and books in the library system.
- Ensure appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented for production use.
- Customize the views and templates using Thymeleaf as required for your application's needs.
